## 💡 What I Do

**Data Analysis & Insights**  
Exploring data, identifying trends, and translating findings into business recommendations that drive decisions.

**Statistical Validation**  
Using hypothesis testing (t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square) and experimental design to validate assumptions and quantify impact—not just correlations.

**Business Intelligence**  
Building interactive dashboards (Power BI, Tableau) that track KPIs and uncover operational insights.

**Automation & Workflows**  
Streamlining data processes with n8n, Python, and Google Apps Script to eliminate manual work and ensure consistency.

*"I believe the best insights come from asking the right questions, testing assumptions with data, and automating what can be automated so you can focus on what actually matters."*
